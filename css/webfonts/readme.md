Square-pixel VGA (AST Premium Exec DOS):
AST's Premium Exec laptop came with a 640x480 VGA LCD, which would vertically squash the normal 400-line text mode, so its configuration utility includes an "Expand mode" option -- which uses a 19-scanline character cell to set up 80x25 text at the screen's native resolution.  
640x480 means square pixels, so the upshot is that this font retains its aspect ratio on present-day monitors (unlike most others here).  AST's customized DOS 5.0 includes 8x19 fonts for multiple codepages, which are combined here in the expanded 'PxPlus' version.

I do not claim any rights to the original raster fonts on which this work is based.  Credit for these goes to their respective designers.
